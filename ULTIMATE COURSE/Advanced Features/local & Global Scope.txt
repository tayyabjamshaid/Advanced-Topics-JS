Js has 3 type of scopes

1-Block Scope
2-Global Scope
3-Function Scope


                        Block Scope

=>let & const provide block level scope

=>if you make a variable with let/const and use it in if statement/loops/blocks,then outside of it,u cannot have access of that let/const variable becoz let is a block scope

{
  let a = 8;
}
console.log(a);

                       Function Scope

Function k andr bnaiy huay variables ko outside of function access ni has

function data() {
    let a = 9;
}
data();
console.log(a)   //it gives error here

                    Global Scope

{
  var a = 8;
}
a = 90;
console.log(a);

or 

let p=99;
function data(){
    p=100;
    console.log(p)
}
data();
console.log(p)
